South Africa has a well-developed suite of policy and legislation for the management, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, including two overarching national tools: the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) and the National Biodiversity Framework (NBF). These documents, developed through thorough stakeholder consultation, set out South Africaâ€™s strategic objectives for managing and conserving biodiversity and are the primary reference points for related priority actions. The NBA both informs the development of the NBSAP and NBF, and supports their implementation. Together the NBSAP, NBF and NBA provide three key, inter-related anchors for the work of the biodiversity sector in South Africa.
